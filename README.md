# moneyTracker
A repository for tracking money. 

Ever since I was working since 15 years old, I trained myself to save money over the years. I would not describe myself as money greedy, however, I am being smarter with my money. There are two different things to look at when it comes to spending your money. Things you need versus the things you want. 
Be sure to know whether if it falls in one of the two categories, before you lead yourself to debt. 
Keep track of where the money goes everyday and set up a financial spending/budget plan for every month based on your monthly income.
